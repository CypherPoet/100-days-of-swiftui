# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day covers Part One of _`Project 9: Drawing`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/44). (Project 9 files can be found in the [directory for Part One](../day-043/).)

It focuses on several specific topics:

- Transforming shapes using CGAffineTransform and even-odd fills
- Creative borders and fills using ImagePaint
- Enabling high-performance Metal rendering with drawingGroup()


Regarding the last point, I love how activating Metal via the `drawingGroup` modifier
couldn't be more straightforward. But it's quite the MjÃ¶lnir. Use it sparingly -- and only as needed.
