# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day covers Part Three of _`Project 18`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/94). (Project 18 files can be found in the [directory for Part One](../day-092/).)

In addition to recapping the material covered during the project's other days, Day 67 focuses on extending the project according to a set of challenges.

# ðŸ¥… Challenges


## Challenge 1

> Change project 8 (Moonshot) so that when you scroll down in MissionView the mission badge image gets smaller. It doesnâ€™t need to shrink away to nothing â€“ going down to maybe 80% is fine.

## Challenge 2

> Change project 5 (Word Scramble) so that words towards the bottom of the list slide in from the right as you scroll. Ideally at least the top 8-10 words should all be positioned normally, but after that they should be offset increasingly to the right.

## Challenge 3

> For a real challenge, make the letter count images in project 5 change color as you scroll. For the best effect, you should create colors using the Color(red:green:blue:) initializer, feeding in values for whichever of red, green, and blue you want to modify.
