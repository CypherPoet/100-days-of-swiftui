_Follow along at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/25_.


# 📒 Field Notes

This This day resolves around recapping the content covered while going through Projects 1-3 in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), and then implementing a challenge project.


In addition to recapping the material covered during the project's other days, Day 25 focuses on extending the project according to a set of challenges.


# 🥅 Challenge Project

From the description:

> Your challenge is to make a brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors.
>
> So, very roughly:
>
> - Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
> - Each turn the app will either prompt the player to win or lose.
> - The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
> - If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
> - The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.
> - So, if the app chose “Rock” and “Win” the player would need to choose “Paper”, but if the app chose - “Rock” and “Lose” the player would need to choose “Scissors”.
