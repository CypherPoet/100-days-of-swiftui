_Follow along at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/35_.


# 📒 Field Notes

This day resolves around recapping the content covered while going through Projects 4-6 in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), and then implementing a challenge project.


# 🥅 Challenge Project

The goal: Build a [multiplication tables](https://www.mathsisfun.com/tables.html) app.

From the description:

> Breaking it down:
>
>   - The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 1 to 12.
>
>   - The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, 20, or “All”.
>
>   - You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for. For the “all” case you should generate all possible combinations.

**Current Status: In Progress 🚧**
