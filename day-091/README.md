# 📒 Field Notes

This day covers Part Six of _`Project 17`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/91). (Project 17 files can be found in the [directory for Part One](../day-086/).)

In addition to recapping the material covered during the project's other days, Day 91 focuses on extending the project according to a set of challenges.

# 🥅 Challenges


## Challenge 1

> Make something interesting for when the timer runs out. At the very least make some text appear, but you should also try designing a custom haptic using Core Haptics.

- 🔗 [Commit](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swiftui-and-combine/commit/4d9d45f3e191dd3a73eb2c3d8100a2f8cd59a5c2)



## Challenge 2

> Add a settings screen that has a single option: Whether or not a card goes back into deck if it was answered incorrectly.

- 🔗 [Commit](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swiftui-and-combine/commit/c9bf108b51eed0a0f6efefdcebe97a1a94a107b5)



## Challenge 3

> If you drag a card to the right but not far enough to remove it, then release, you see it turn red as it slides back to the center. Why does this happen and how can you fix it?

- Perhaps it's because I built the app a bit differently, but I couldn't reproduce this 🤷‍♂️.
