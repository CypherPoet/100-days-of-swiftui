# Day 19: Challenge Day


_Follow along at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19_.


This is the first "challenge day" of _100 Days of SwiftUI_ -- wherein we're asked to build a completely new app from scratch relying on the material covered so far.


# ðŸ¥… Challenge

> You need to build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.
>
> Which units you choose are down to you.

I ended up choosing two sets of conversions: Bitcoin-to-Satoshi, and temperature units. The former was straightforward, one-to-one comparison of currency values; the latter was slightly move involved -- with multiple segment pickers for switching among a handful of potential units.

Why would you want an app that specifically converted Bitcoin and temperature side-by-side. Not entirely sure â€” but a rewarding SwiftUI challenge nonetheless ðŸ˜ƒ.
