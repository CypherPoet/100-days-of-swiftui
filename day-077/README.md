# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day resolves around recapping the content covered while going through Projects 13-15 in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), and then implementing a challenge project.


# ðŸ¥… Challenge Project


From the description:

> Your goal is to build an app that asks users to import a picture from their photo library, then attach a name to whatever they imported.


I've really gotten to like the `PlaceCase` app I built for Project 14. So I'm going to put a few twists on this milestone. `PlaceCase` already has a view for editing a specific location on the map, so I'm thinking this would be a perfect place to allow users to attach custom photo to the location as well.
