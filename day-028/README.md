# Day 28: _Project 4: BetterRest_ (Part Three)

_Follow along at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/28_.


# 📒 Field Notes

This day covers Part Three of _`Project 4: BetterRest`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/28). (Project 4 files can be found in the [directory for Part One](../day-026/).)


In addition to recapping the material covered during the project's other days, Day 24 focuses on extending the project according to a set of challenges.


# 🥅 Challenges


## Challenge 1

> Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the VStack layout? It’s your app – you choose!

- Already covered in Day 27 🙂.

Regarding preferences, though, `Form` gives us built-in scrolling functionality and is more semantically appropriate for what we're building -- so I'd probably lean in that direction.


## Challenge 2

> Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a `Picker` showing the same range of values.

## Challenge 3

> Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.
