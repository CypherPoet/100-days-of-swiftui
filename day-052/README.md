# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day covers Part Four of _`Project 10: CupcakeCorner`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/52). (Project 10 files can be found in the [directory for Part One](../day-049/).)


In addition to recapping the material covered during the project's other days, Day 52 focuses on extending the project according to a set of challenges.

# ðŸ¥… Challenges


## Challenge 1

> Our address fields are currently considered valid if they contain anything, even if itâ€™s just only whitespace. Improve the validation to make sure a string of pure whitespace is invalid.


- ðŸ”— [Commit](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swiftui/commit/3c41fd816510350a9f94de352294d5e93854014e)



## Challenge 2

> If our call to `placeOrder()` fails â€“ for example if there is no internet connection â€“ show an informative alert for the user. To test this, just disable WiFi on your Mac so the simulator has no connection either.


- (Already covered ðŸ™‚)



## Challenge 3

> For a more challenging task, see if you can convert our data model from a class to a struct, then create an `ObservableObject` class wrapper around it that gets passed around. This will result in your class having one `@Published` property, which is the data struct inside it, and should make supporting Codable on the struct much easier.


- Sort of already covered ðŸ™‚. I commented on the approach I took with this in [Day 49](../day-049/README.md))
