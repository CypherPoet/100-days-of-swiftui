_Follow along at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/18_.


# 📒 Field Notes

This day covers Part Three of _`Project 1: WeSplit`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16). (Project files can be found in the [directory for Part One](../day-016/).)

In addition to recapping the material covered during the project's other days, Day 18 focuses on extending the project according to a set of challenges.



# 🥅 Challenges


## Challenge 1

> Add a header to the third section, saying "Amount per person."

I sort of got up to this already with a "Your Split" section -- but this was an opportunity to sync that up with the navbar appearance.

## Challenge 2

> Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.

This actually goes nicely as a footer in the same section that lists the final split.

## Challenge 3

> Change the “Number of people” picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type.
