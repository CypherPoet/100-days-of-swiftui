# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day covers Part One of _`Project 19`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/96).

It focuses on several specific topics:

- SnowSeeker: Introduction
- Working with two side by side views in SwiftUI
- Using alert() and sheet() with optionals
- Using groups as transparent layout containers




## SnowSeeker: Introduction

From the project description:

> In this project weâ€™re going to create SnowSeeker: an app to let users browse ski resorts around the world.
>
> ...
>
> This will be the first app where we specifically aim to make something that works great on iPad by showing two views side by side, but youâ€™ll also get deep into solving problematic layouts, learn a new way to show sheets and alerts, and more.



## Working with two side by side views in SwiftUI


SwiftUI doesn't have a direct equivalent of UIKit's `UISplitViewController`, but, instead, relies on defining the structure of the `NavigationView` and having the system handle the "splitting" depending on the layout of the device.


## Using alert() and sheet() with optionals

Sometimes we want to show an alert or sheet if a Boolean value is true. Sometimes we want to show it if a value exists altogether. (Side note: This is why Optionals can be useful in general ðŸ™‚).

Thankfully, SwiftUI gives us a version of the `alert` or `sheet` modifiers that can bind to the existence of an `Identifiable` Optional. Much more useful than driving a Boolean with side-effects ðŸ’ª.
