# 📒 Field Notes

This day resolves around recapping the content covered while going through Projects 7-9 in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), and then implementing a challenge project.


# 🥅 Challenge Project

The goal: Build a habit-tracking app... for people who want to track things.


This project is still in progress 🚧. The 100 Days of SwiftUI, however, continues ⚡️.
