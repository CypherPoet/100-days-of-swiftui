 - I manually removed the `isButton` trait and add the `isLink` trait from the `NavigationLink` in the Missions List to have it read as a link. I'm not sure if this is a bug, though -- or if `Button` is actually supposed to be the official trait ðŸ¤”.


- Using a `decorative` Image for each mission's insignia. A more advanced approach would be writing
detailed visual descriptions of each insignia and supplying those for the accessibility label.

- Using a `decorative` Image for each astronaut's photo on their details page.
