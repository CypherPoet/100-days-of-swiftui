# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day covers Part Four of _`Project 16`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/82). (Project 16 files can be found in the [directory for Part One](../day-079/).)

It focuses on several specific topics:


- Building our tab bar
- Sharing data across tabs using @EnvironmentObject
- Dynamically filtering a SwiftUI List



## Building our tab bar


From the project description:

> This app is going to display four SwiftUI views inside a tab bar: one to show everyone that you met, one to show people you have contacted, another to show people you havenâ€™t contacted, and a final one showing your information for others to scan.
