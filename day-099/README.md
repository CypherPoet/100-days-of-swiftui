# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day covers Part Four of _`Project 19`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/99). (Project 19 files can be found in the [directory for Part One](../day-096/).)

In addition to recapping the material covered during the project's other days, Day 67 focuses on extending the project according to a set of challenges.

# ðŸ¥… Challenges


## Challenge 1

> Add a photo credit over the ResortView image. The data is already loaded from the JSON for this purpose, so you just need to make it look good in the UI.

Given that I'm using `MKMapSnapshotter` snapshots as a sort of "detail image view", this would be a good opportunity to overlay an annotation image to mark the center point.

## Challenge 2

> Fill in the loading and saving methods for Favorites.

- The `@UserDefault` property wrapper takes care of this nicely.



## Challenge 3

> For a real challenge, let the user sort and filter the resorts in ContentView. For sorting use default, alphabetical, and country, and for filtering let them select country, size, or price.
