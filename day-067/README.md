# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day covers Part Five of _`Project 13: Instafilter`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/67). (Project 13 files can be found in the [directory for Part One](../day-062/).)


In addition to recapping the material covered during the project's other days, Day 67 focuses on extending the project according to a set of challenges.

# ðŸ¥… Challenges


## Challenge 1

> Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.


- ðŸ”— I [disabled it](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swiftui/blob/e508591135190e093a2cf105482d7ec63385e84a/day-062/Projects/Instafilter/Instafilter/Scenes/Filtering/ImageFilteringView.swift#L139) instead ðŸ˜›.



## Challenge 2

> Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.


- ðŸ”— Already Covered [in a similar manner](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swiftui/blob/e508591135190e093a2cf105482d7ec63385e84a/day-062/Projects/Instafilter/Instafilter/Scenes/Filtering/ImageFilteringView.swift#L45).



## Challenge 3

> Experiment with having more than one slider control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.


- ðŸ”— I ended up experimenting this as part of Day 66. I came up with a way to [dynamically render filter-appropriate sliders](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swiftui/blob/e508591135190e093a2cf105482d7ec63385e84a/day-062/Projects/Instafilter/Instafilter/Scenes/Filtering/ImageFilteringView.swift#L100) inside of a `ForEach` block.
