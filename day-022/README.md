In addition to recapping the material covered during the project's other days, Day 18 focuses on extending the project according to a set of challenges.


# 🥅 Challenges


## Challenge 1

> Add an `@State` property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert.

- (Already Covered 🙂)


## Challenge 2

> Show the player’s current score in a label directly below the flags.
