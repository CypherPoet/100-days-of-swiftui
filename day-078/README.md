# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day resolves around continuing the [Milestone challenge started in Day 77](../day-077/).


# ðŸ¥… Challenge Project


From the description:

> ... show a map with a pin on that marked where they were when that pin was added.


Given that I decided to keep extending the `PlaceCase` app for Day 77, I'll be doing the same here.
This seems like a good opportunity to add a button to the map view that snaps the center to the user's current location.

(The commit for these changes can be found [here](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swiftui/commit/c59b394f73cda09a426b777e3049afd22704ae66).)
