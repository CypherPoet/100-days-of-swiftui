# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day covers Part Five of _`Project 14`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/72). (Project 14 files can be found in the [directory for Part One](../day-068/).)


It focuses on several specific topics:

- Making someone elseâ€™s class conform to Codable
- Locking our UI behind Face ID


Due to the slightly... custom... direction I took with this project, I implemented `Codable` conformance for the `WikiPage` objects that I'm fetching, and using Core Data for everything else.

That said, I did still expand a bit on the support for Face ID authentication.
