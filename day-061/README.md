_Follow along at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/61_.


# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day revolves around refactoring the milestone project from Day 60 to use Core Data for its underlying models -- while also persisting the data we fetch so that it can be used offline.

The commit for this day's changes can be found [here](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swiftui/commit/46f3a93100bb805a563d155fceab62bae059eeaa), while all project files can be found in the [folder for Day 60](../day-060/).
