# ðŸ¥… Challenges

From the description:

> All three of these tasks require you to modify the `FilteredList` view we made.



## Challenge 1

> Make the `FilteredList` view accept an array of `NSSortDescriptor` objects to get used in its fetch request.

## Challenge 2

> Make the `FilteredList` view accept a string parameter that controls which predicate is applied. You can use Swiftâ€™s string interpolation to place this in the predicate.

- ðŸ”— [Commit](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swiftui/commit/241e97cf17cc79c903a4e3bd51a7421fff653d14)



## Challenge 3

> Modify the predicate string parameter to be an enum such as .beginsWith, then make that enum get resolved to a string inside the initializer.

- ðŸ”— [Commit](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swiftui/commit/b42f48bc1955442c5ceb2f0d175fd36de29073b5)
