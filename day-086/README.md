# üìí Field Notes

This day covers Part One of _`Project 17`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/86).

It focuses on several specific topics:

- Flashzilla: Introduction
- How to use gestures in SwiftUI
- Making vibrations with UINotificationFeedbackGenerator and Core Haptics
- Disabling user interactivity with allowsHitTesting()




## Flashzilla: Introduction

From the project description:

> In this project we‚Äôre going to build an app that helps users learn things using flashcards ‚Äì cards with one thing written on the front, such as ‚Äúto buy‚Äù, and another thing written on the other side, such as ‚Äúcomprar‚Äù.



## How to use gestures in SwiftUI

My intuition for when to use `@GestureState` vs `@State` when updating the UI via gestures remains a bit tenuous -- but I'm definitely seeing how the former can be useful: `@GestureState` is way of telling SwiftUI that this value can _only_ be mutated during a gesture's `updating` callback. `@State` is much more liberal.
