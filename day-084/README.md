# ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day covers Part Six of _`Project 16`_ in the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/84). (Project 16 files can be found in the [directory for Part One](../day-079/).)

It focuses on several specific topics:


- Saving and loading data with UserDefaults
- Posting notifications to the lock screen



## Saving and loading data with UserDefaults

Core Data seems like the better choice for modeling and saving Contact entities -- so I went that approach. I did use `UserDefaults` for the user's own preferences, though. It's cool to see how the two can be mixed ðŸ™‚.



## Posting notifications to the lock screen
